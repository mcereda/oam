# Tech radar

It **is** [Zalando's tech radar], just customized.

Serves a static page.

There are **4** quadrants.<br/>
Quadrants start from the **bottom right** and go clockwise: `0` is _bottom right_, `1` is _bottom left_, `2` is
_top left_, `3` is _top right_.

Moved: `-1` is _down_, `0` is _stationary_, `1` is _up_.
