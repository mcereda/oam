## Troubleshooting

### While loading, a completion fails with error `No such file or directory`

Example:

```sh
tee: /Users/user/.antigen/bundles/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/cache//completions/_helm: No such file or directory
/Users/user/.antigen/bundles/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/plugins/helm/helm.plugin.zsh:source:9: no such file or directory: /Users/user/.antigen/bundles/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/cache//completions/_helm
```

The issue is due of the `$ZSH_CACHE_DIR/completions` being missing and `tee` not creating it on Mac OS X. Create the missing `completions` directory and re-run antigen:

```sh
mkdir -p $ZSH_CACHE_DIR/completions
antigen apply
```
