## TL;DR

```makefile
# Assign default values, but allow override.
# Usage: `make override_me=new_value target`.
override override_me ?= default_value


# Load env files.
# If prefixed with '-' it does not error should any of the files not exist.
include .env
-include .env.local .env.extra


# Export variables for all programs to see.
# Only exported in the commands' sub-shells.
export

# Export specific variables only.
export override_me


# Assign shell command outputs as values.
command_output = ${shell command with args}


# Target-specific variables.
# Call targets from targets.
# Check variables are set.
target_name: target_specific_variable = value
target_name: dash_instead_of_underscore = ${subst _,-,${override_me}}
target_name: previous_target required_file.ext
    ${info output string}
    echoed_command
    @quiet_command
    ${MAKE} next_target

previous_target:
    @quiet_command

next_target:
    @[ "${var}" ] && echo "all good" || ( echo "var is not set"; exit 1 )


# Conditionals.
ifeq "${shell uname}" "Darwin"
expiration_date = ${shell date -v "+365d" "+%FT%TZ"}
else ifeq "${shell uname}" "Linux"
expiration_date = ${shell date -d "+1 year" "+%FT%TZ"}
endif
```

```makefile
repository_name = $(shell basename $$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))

override environment_id ?= dev
override tf_plan_file ?= ${environment_id}.tfplan
override tf_vars_file ?= ${environment_id}.tfvars

-include .env
export

pre-flight:
    ${info validating terraform's configuration…}
    @terraform fmt -recursive
    @terraform validate

ifeq "${destroy}" "1"
tf_destroy_switch = -destroy
endif

plan: pre-flight ${tf_vars_file}
    ${info planning ${environment_id}'s resources…}
    @terraform plan ${tf_destroy_switch} -var-file='${tf_vars_file}' -input=false -out='${tf_plan_file}'

apply: plan ${tf_plan_file}
    ${info applying ${environment_id}'s plan}
    @terraform apply '${tf_plan_file}'

ifeq "test-db-connection" "$(findstring test-db-connection,$(MAKECMDGOALS))"
-include db.env db.secret.env
endif
test-db-connection: override PSQL ?= psql
test-db-connection: override PGPASSWORD ?= ${password}
test-db-connection: ${shell which 'psql'}
    @${PSQL} -h '${host}' -p '${port}' -U '${username}' '${database}' -c '\q'
```

## Load .env files in the Makefile

Use one of those at the top of a Makefile to include and make available all variables in `.env`:

```makefile
include .env
-include .env.local .env.extra
```

```makefile
ifneq (,$(wildcard ./.env))
  include .env
  export
endif
```

`ifneq` + `wildcard` is a typical way to check a file exists.

`include .env` imports `.env` into the Makefile variables.<br/>
If prefixed with '-' (`-include`), it does not error nor warning should any of the included files not exist.

`export` without parameters exports all variables set until now.

## Load targets from other Makefiles

```makefile
include ../Makefile
-include something.make
```
