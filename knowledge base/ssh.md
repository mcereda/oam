```

## Server installation on Windows

Needs Administrator privileges.<br/>
Tested on Window 11 22H2.

Via PowerShell:

1. Install the server component:

   ```ps1
   Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server
   ```

1. Start and enable the service:

   ```ps1
   Start-Service sshd
   Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
   ```

1. Verify the firewall rule has been created automatically during the installation:

   ```ps1
   if (!(Get-NetFirewallRule -Name "OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Enabled)) {
     Write-Output "Firewall Rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' does not exist, creating it..."
     New-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
   } else {
     Write-Output "Firewall rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' has been created and exists."
   }
   ```

Via GUI:

1. Open _Settings_ > _Apps_, then select _Optional features_
1. Scan the list to see if the OpenSSH server is not already installed
1. At the top of the page, select _View features_ in the _Add an optional feature_ field
1. Find _OpenSSH Server_ and select _Install_
1. Once the setup completes, return to _Apps_ > _Optional features_ and confirm OpenSSH is now listed
1. Open the _Services_ desktop app:

   1. Select Start
   1. Type `services.msc` in the search box
   1. Select the _Services_ app or just press ENTER

1. In the details panel, double-click _OpenSSH SSH Server_ to enter its properties
1. On the _General_ tab, from the _Startup type_ drop-down menu, select _Automatic_ to enable the service
1. In the same tab, select _Start_ to start the service

## Key Management

Create a new key:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t 'rsa' -b '4096'
ssh-keygen -t 'dsa'
ssh-keygen -t 'ecdsa' -b '521'
ssh-keygen -t 'ed25519' -f '.ssh/id_ed25519' -C 'test@winzoz'
```

```txt
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\test/.ssh/id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\test/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:lFrpPyqTy0d30TfnN0QRY678LnyCzmvMDbl1Qj2/U/w test@winzoz
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|           +o.o++|
|             ==*O|
|            . .X*|
|         o .   +=|
|        S S +..==|
|         . .+..*E|
|           + ...o|
|         .+ .o = |
|          =+ .o .|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Remove a host from the list of known hosts:

```sh
ssh-keygen -R 'pi4.lan'
ssh-keygen -R '192.168.1.237' -f '.ssh/known_hosts'
ssh-keygen -R 'raspberrypi.lan' -f '.ssh/known_hosts'
```

```txt
Host pi4.lan found: line 5
/home/user/.ssh/known_hosts updated.
Original contents retained as /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```

Change password of a key file

```sh
ssh-keygen -f "${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa" -p
```

## Client configuration

When connecting to a host, the SSH client will use settings:

1. from the command line,
1. from the user's `~/.ssh/config` file,
1. from the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file

Unless noted otherwise, for each parameter, only the **first** obtained value will be used
(_first-come-first-served_).<br/>
Values should hence appear from the most **specific** to the most **generic**, both by file and by position in those
files.

The configuration files contain sections separated by `Host` specifications<br/>
Those sections are only applied to hosts that match one of the patterns given in each specification.

The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.<br/>
Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are interpreted as comments.<br/>
Arguments may optionally be enclosed in **double** quotes (`"`) in order to represent arguments containing spaces.<br/>
Configuration options may be separated by whitespace, or optional whitespace and exactly one `=`. The latter format is
useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace when specifying configuration options using the ssh, scp, and sftp `-o`
option.<br/>
Keywords are case-**in**sensitive and arguments are case-**sensitive**.

```ssh-config
Host targaryen
    HostName targaryen.example.com
    User john
    Port 2322
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/targaryen.key
    LogLevel INFO
    Compression yes

Host *ell
    user oberyn
    sendenv BE_SASSY
    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Host * !martell
    LogLevel INFO
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null

Host *
    User root
    Compression yes
    SendEnv -LC_* -LANG*
    SetEnv MYENV=itsvalue
```

### Append domains to a hostname before attempting to check if they exist

```ssh-config
CanonicalizeHostname yes
CanonicalDomains xxx.auckland.ac.nz yyy.auckland.ac.nz

Host  *.xxx.auckland.ac.nz
    User user_xxx
Host  *.yyy.auckland.ac.nz
    User user_yyy
```

### Optimize connection handling

```ssh-config
# Keep a connection open for 30s and reuse it when possible.
# Save the above pipe in a safe directory, and use a hash of different data to
# identify it.
# source: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-reuse-openssh-connection/
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/control-%C
ControlPersist 30s
```

### Integrate with GnuPG

```sh
# In BASH and alike.
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs 'agent-ssh-socket')

# In FISH.
set -x 'SSH_AUTH_SOCK' (gpgconf --list-dirs 'agent-ssh-socket')
```

```ssh-config
# In ~/.ssh/config.
# Value is from `gpgconf --list-dirs 'agent-ssh-socket'`.
IdentityAgent ~/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh
```

## Server configuration

The daemon's default configuration file is `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.<br/>
Reload the server upon config file change. No need to restart it.

The configuration file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.<br/>
Unless noted otherwise, for each keyword, the **first** obtained value is used (_first-come-first-served_).<br/>
Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are interpreted as comments.<br/>
Arguments may optionally be enclosed in **double** quotes (`"`) in order to represent arguments containing spaces.<br/>
Keywords are case-**in**sensitive and arguments are case-**sensitive**.

**Some** Linux distributions (e.g., Debian, OpenSUSE) started including `.conf` files in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` and
`/usr/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` as first thing in the base configuration file:

```ssh-config
# To modify the system-wide sshd configuration, create a "*.conf" file under
# "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/" which will be automatically included below.
# Don't edit this configuration file itself if possible to avoid update
# problems.
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.
Include /usr/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```

This avoids issues from updates overwriting the default file and allows user configurations to override defaults in a
cleaner way.

### Change port

```ssh-config
Port 2222
```

### Disable password authentication

```ssh-config
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

### Permit root login

```ssh-config
PermitRootLogin yes
```

### Conditional blocks

> Only a subset of keywords may be used in a _Match_ block. Check the [`SSHD_CONFIG(5)`][sshd_config man page] man page.

```ssh-config
Match Address 192.168.111.0/24
    PasswordAuthentication no
    PermitRootLogin no
```

## SSHFS

Notable options:

- `auto_cache` enables caching based on modification times;
- `reconnect` reconnects to the server;
- `defer_permissions` works around the issue where certain shares may mount properly, but cause _permissions denied_
  errors when accessed (caused by how Mac OS X's Finder translates and interprets permissions;
- `noappledouble` prevents Mac OS X to write `.DS_Store` files on the remote file system;
- `volname` defines the name to use for the volume.

Usage:

```sh
sshfs \
  -o 'auto_cache,reconnect,defer_permissions,noappledouble,volname=Data'
  'user@nas.lan:/path/to/remote/dir' \
  '/path/to/local/dir'
```

### Installation

```sh
# Mac OS X requires `macports`, since `brew` does not offer 'sshfs' anymore
sudo port install 'sshfs'
```

## Troubleshooting

### No matching host key type found

Error message example:

> `Unable to negotiate with XXX port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa.`

Cause: the server only supports the kind of RSA with SHA-1, which is considered weak and deprecated in newer SSH
versions.

Workaround: explicitly set your client to use the specified key type adding

```ssh-config
HostkeyAlgorithms        +ssh-rsa
PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
```

to your `~/.ssh/config` like so:

```diff
 Host  azure-devops
     IdentityFile              ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     IdentitiesOnly            yes
+    HostkeyAlgorithms         +ssh-rsa
+    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms  +ssh-rsa
```

Solution: update the SSH server.
