## Specify when to run jobs

Refer [Specify when jobs run with `rules`][specify when jobs run with rules] and the
[`rules` syntax reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules).

Use the `rules` key and specify the conditions the job needs.

> The `only`/`except` keywords have been deprecated by the `rules` keyword, and cannot be used together.<br/>
> This means one might be forced to use `only`/`except` if one is including a pipeline that is already using them.

Rules are evaluated when the pipeline is created, **in order**, until the first applies. The rest are ignored.

The `rules`key accepts an array of rules.<br/>
Each rule:

- Must have **at least one** of:

  - `if`, to run a job when specific conditions are met.
  - `changes`, to run a job when specific files changed.
  - `exists`, to run a job when certain files exist in the repository.
  - `when`, to run a job when exact conditions are met.

- Can have **zero or more** of:

  - `allow_failure`, to allow a job to fail without stopping the pipeline.<br/>
    Defaults to `false`.
  - `needs`, to specify conditions for the job to run.
  - `variables`, to define specific variables for the job.
  - `interruptible`, to cancel the current job should another pipeline start.

Multiple keys from the above lists can be combined to create complex rules.

`when` accepts the following:

- `on_success` (default): run the job only when no jobs in earlier stages fail, or the failing ones are allowed to fail
  with `allow_failure: true`.<br/>
  This is the default behavior when one combines `when` with `if`, `changes`, or `exists`.
- `on_failure`: run the job only when at least one job in an earlier stage fails.
- `never`: don't run the job regardless of the status of jobs in earlier stages.
- `always`: run the job regardless of the status of jobs in earlier stages.
- `manual`: add the job to the pipeline as a manual job.
  When this condition is used, `allow_failure`for the job defaults to `false`.
- `delayed`: add the job to the pipeline as a delayed job.

Jobs are **added** to the pipeline if:

- An `if`, `changes`, or `exists` rule matches **and** the rule is configured with `when: on_success` (default if not
  defined), `when: delayed`, or `when: always`.
- A rule is reached that only consists of `when: on_success`, `when: delayed`, or `when: always`.

Jobs are **not** added to the pipeline if:

- No rule matches.
- A rule matches **and** the rule is configured with `when: never`.

Gotchas:

- Tag pipelines, scheduled pipelines, and manual pipelines do **not** have a Git push event associated with them.
- `changes` always evaluates to true for new branch pipelines or when there is no Git push event.<br/>
  This means it will try to run on tag, scheduled and manual pipelines. Use `changes.compare_to` to specify the branch
  to compare against.
- `changes` and `exists` allow a maximum of 50 patterns or file paths.
- Multiple entries in the `changes` condition are validated in an `OR` fashion.
- Glob patterns in `changes` and `exists` are interpreted with Ruby's `File.fnmatch` function using the
  `File::FNM_PATHNAME | File::FNM_DOTMATCH | File::FNM_EXTGLOB` flag.
- The [`push` pipeline source](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#push-events)
  should™ limit jobs to code changes or deliberate pushes.<br/>
  Scheduled pipelines should™ avoid triggering jobs with this condition as they present a `schedule` source instead.

  Using the `merge_request_event` source in place of `push` prevents the job to run should somebody push to the default
  branch, even though
  [the documentation clearly states it includes merges](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#merge-request-events).

  [Linting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/lint.html#check-cicd-syntax) and
  [simulations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/lint.html#simulate-a-pipeline) seem to accept using other ways, but then
  the pipeline resulted to be **invalid** after committing those _"validated"_ changes:

  > 🛑 Unable to create pipeline
  >
  > Failed to parse rule for test-job: rules:changes:compare_to is not a valid ref

Examples:

<details>
  <summary>Run when some specific files change</summary>

```yaml
docker-build:
  rules:
    - changes:
        - cmd/*
        - go.*
        - Dockerfile

pulumi-update:
  rules:
    # This job should only be created for changes to the main branch, and only if any program-related file changed.
    - if: >-
        $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
        && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
      changes:
        paths:
          - infra/*.ts
          - infra/packages.json
    - when: never
```

The condition above will make the job run only when a change occurs:

- to any file in the `cmd` directory
- to any file in the repository's root directory which name starts with `go` (like `go.mod` or `go.sum`)
- to the `Dockerfile` in the repository's root directory

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Run on schedules</summary>

```yaml
docker-build:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"

docker-run:
  only:
    - schedule
```

Refer [Using GitLab scheduled pipelines simplified 101] to configure and activate schedules.<br/>
Manually trigger scheduled pipelines from the UI or using the API:

```plaintext
POST /projects/:id/pipeline_schedules/:pipeline_schedule_id/play
```

```sh
curl -X POST -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: glpat-m-…" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/42/pipeline_schedules/1/play"
```

The triggered pipeline runs immediately.<br/>
The next scheduled run of the pipeline is **not** affected.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Only run on specific events</summary>

```yaml
docker-build:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
    - # Disable for all other conditions
      when: never
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Run on all conditions except specific ones</summary>

```yaml
docker-build:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
      when: never
```

</details>

## Specify when to run entire pipelines

Refer the [`workflow.rules` syntax reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#workflowrules).

The `workflow.rules` keyword is similar to the `rules` keyword defined in jobs, but controls whether or not a whole
pipeline is created.<br/>
When no rules evaluate to `true`, the pipeline as a whole will not run.

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - # Override the globally-defined DEPLOY_VARIABLE on commits on the default branch.
      if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
      variables:
        DEPLOY_VARIABLE: "deploy-production"
    - # Add a new variable on commits containing 'feature'.
      if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME =~ /feature/
      variables:
        IS_A_FEATURE: "true"
    - # Skip on commits ending with '-draft'.
      if: $CI_COMMIT_TITLE =~ /-draft$/
      when: never
    - # Run for merge requests where key files changed.
      if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      changes:
        - packages.json
    - when: always                            # Run the pipeline in other cases.
```

## External secrets

Refer [Using external secrets in CI].

## API

Refer [Pipeline schedules API].

## Git options

Refer [Push options].

```sh
# Skip *branch* pipelines for the latest push.
# Does *not* skip merge request pipelines or pipelines for integrations.
git push -o 'ci.skip'

# Skip pipelines *for integrations* for the latest push.
# Does *not* skip branch or merge request pipelines.
git push -o 'integrations.skip_ci'

# Provide variables to pipelines created due to the push.
# Passes variables only to *branch* pipelines, and *not* to merge request pipelines.
git push -o ci.variable="MAX_RETRIES=10" -o ci.variable="MAX_TIME=600"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline fails with error `You are not allowed to download code from this project`

Error message example:

```txt
Getting source from Git repository 00:00
Fetching changes with git depth set to 20...
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /builds/myProj/myRepo/.git/
remote: You are not allowed to download code from this project.
fatal: unable to access 'https://gitlab.com/myProj/myRepo.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

Root cause: the user starting the pipeline does not have enough privileges to the repository.

Solution: give that user _developer_ access or have somebody else with enough privileges run it.
