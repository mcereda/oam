## TL;DR

<details>
  <summary>Diagrams</summary>

Use [mermaid.js] to include diagrams and graphs.

See also [The magical Markdown I bet you don't know] and [slaise/High-level-Markdown].

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Folded content</summary>

Use a `<details>` HTML tag:

```md
<details>
  <summary>Fold/Open</summary>
  Folded content
</details>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Math</summary>

Inline expressions: surround the expression with `$`.

```md
$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$
```

$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$

Block expressions: surround the expression with `$$`.

```md
$$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$
```

$$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Syntax highlighting in code blocks</summary>

Specify the language right after the code block's opening:

```ruby
def index
  puts "hello world"
end
```

```csharp
private void index(){
  MessageBox.Show("hello world");
}
```

Refer [Syntax highlighting in markdown] and [linguist supported language syntax list] for recognized languages and their
aliases.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>To do lists</summary>

Use `[ ]` after the bullet point or numbered list character to switch them for an empty ballot box, and `[x]` for a
checked one.

1. [ ] 1
1. [ ] 2
   - [x] a

- [x] Point 3

## Images

Add an image:

```md
![description](path/to.image)
![description][reference name]
```

Control width and height:

```md
<img src="./cat.png" width=300px height=200px />
```

Align in the center:

```md
<div align="center">![sleep-cat](./cat.png)</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Escape the backtick character

Include a non-code formatted backtick by escaping it normally (with a `\`).

Render it in an inline code block using double backticks instead of single backticks.

Alternatively, use a code block. This will wrap everything in a `<pre>` HTML tag.<br/>
To do this, either indent 4 spaces to start a code block, or use fenced code blocks if supported.

### Render mermaid.js graphs in VS Code's Markdown preview

Install and enable [`bierner.markdown-mermaid`][bierner.markdown-mermaid]'s extension.
