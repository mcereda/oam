# Architectural decision records

Architectural Decisions (ADs) are justified design choices, addressing functional or non-functional requirements that
are architecturally significant.

Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) are requirements that has a measurable effect on the architecture, and
quality of a software and/or hardware system.

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) capture a single AD and its rationale.<br/>
ADR are meant to help one understand the reasons for a chosen architectural decision, along with its trade-offs and
consequences.

The collection of ADRs that are created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log.<br/>
All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM), but ADR usage can be extended to design and
other decisions (_any decision record_).
