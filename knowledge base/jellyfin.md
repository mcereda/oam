# Jellyfin

Free software media system.<br/>
Allows streaming to any device from one's own server, with no strings attached.

## TL;DR

_Libraries_ are virtual collections of media.<br/>
They can contain files from several different locations on the server.

One will see a page to add libraries when they first create the server.<br/>
Libraries can be then added, modified, or removed at any time from the settings.

1. Log in to Jellyfin's web interface in the web browser.
1. On the user menu in the top right corner, select _Dashboard_.
1. On the left side menu, in the _Server_ section, select _Libraries_ > _Libraries_.
1. Take action:
   - Click _Add Media Library_ to add a new library.
   - Click the hamburger menu of the library to modify, then select _Manage library_ to make changes to it.
   - Click the hamburger menu of the library to delete, then select _Remove_ to delete it.

A single library can encompass multiple paths.<br/>
Exclude a folder and its children from scans by creating **empty** `.ignore` files within those directories.<br/>
Exclude only specific files and folders from scans by **listing** them in the `.ignore` file within their directory. Use
the same format as git's `.gitignore` files. This feature is available since version 10.11.

The three most common types of content are _movies_, _shows_, and _music_.<br/>
These have the best support in client apps. One can also add other types of media, such as books or photos.<br/>
When having different types of media in a single folder, one can also label it as _mixed_. In this case, it will be a
generic folder view that displays all files in that library. Use of this type is currently discouraged.

Jellyfin **suggests** organizing and naming files in specific ways depending on their content type.<br/>
Doing so automates the recognition process, but allows to manually identify the media later.

  <summary>Movies</summary>

Refer [Media / Movies][documentation / media / movies].

Movies should be organized into individual folders for each movie. The folder can optionally contain extra files.<br/>
The folder containing the movie should be named in the format `Name (optional year) [optional metadata provider id]`.

Refer [Media / Shows][documentation / media / shows].

Shows should be organized into series folders, then into season folders under each series.<br/>
The folder containing the show should be named in the format `Name (optional year) [optional metadata provider id]`.

## Use hardware acceleration for transcoding

Refer to [Hardware Acceleration][Transcoding / Hardware acceleration].

Docker images contain all the required packages. Other installation methods might skip those.

Settings under Account icon > _Administration_ > _Dashboard_ > _Playback_ > _Transcoding_.

> [!important]
> For some reason, enabling the _Enable hardware encoding_ option in the _Hardware encoding options_ section breaks the
> transcoding command.<br/>
> The rest seems to be working though.

When transcoded files are not meant to be saved, consider:

- Deleting old transcoded segments after they have been downloaded by the client.
- Setting the cache to be on a RamDisk (`tmpfs`).

  <details style='padding: 0 0 1rem 1rem'>

  ```dockerfile
  services:
    jellyfin:
      …
      volumes:
        …
        - type: tmpfs
          tmpfs:
            mode: 0o01777
          target: /cache
  ```

  </details>

The _Allow encoding in HEVC format_ and _Allow encoding in AV1 format_ under the _Encoding format options_ section
happened to really slow down playback.
