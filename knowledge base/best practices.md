# OAM best practices

What really worked for me.

1. [Generic concepts](#generic-concepts)

1. [Sources](#sources)

## Generic concepts

- Always think critically.<br/>
  If you do/think things just bEcAuSe OtHeRs SaId So, all you're doing is admitting **both** that you know no better **and** that you're not willing to consider otherwise.
- The _one-size-fits-all_ approach is a big fat lie.<br/>
  You'll end up with stiff, hard to change results that satisfy nobody. This proved particularly true with regards to templates and pipelines.
- Apply the KISS approach wherever possible.<br/>
  Consider it not as _keeping all things simple because they need to be simple_, but as an invite to keep things simple **with respect of your ultimate goal**.<br/>
  Beware of simplicity for the sake of simplicity, specially if this makes things complicated on a higher level. Check out [KISS principle is not that simple].
- Beware of complex things that sHoUlD bE sImPlE.<br/>
  Check out the [SAFe] delusion.
- There is no perfect nor correct solution, just different sets of tradeoff.<br/>
  Find the one that most satisfies you and your **current** necessities.
- Review every decision after some time. Check they are still relevant, or if there is some improvement you can implement.<br/>
  Things change constantly: new technologies are given birth often, and processes improve.
- Focus on what matters, but also set time aside to check up the rest.<br/>
  Check [Understanding the pareto principle (the 80/20 rule)].
- Learn from your (and others') mistakes.
- Put in place processes to avoid repeating mistakes.<br/>
  Check out the [5 whys] approach.
- Automate when and where you can, yet mind [the automation paradox].<br/>
  Check also out [`pre-commit`][pre-commit].
- Keep things **de**coupled where possible, the same way [_interfaces_ are used in programming][what does it mean to program to interfaces?].<br/>
  This allows for quick and (as much as possible) painless switch between technologies.
- Choose tools based on **how helpful** they are to achieve your goals.<br/>
  Do **not** adapt your work to specific tools.
- Backup your data, especially when you are about to update something.<br/>
  [Murphy's law] is lurking. Consider [the 3-2-1 backup strategy].
- [Branch early, branch often].
- [Keep changes short and sweet][the art of small pull requests].<br/>
  Nobody likes to dive deep into a 1200 lines, 356 files pull request ([PR fatigue][how to tackle pull request fatigue], everybody?).
- Consider keeping changes in _behaviour_ (logic) separated from changes to the structure.<br/>
  It allows for easier debugging by letting you deal with one great issue at a time.
- Make changes easy, avoid making easy changes.<br/>
  Easy changes will build up long term and become a pain to deal with.
- [Trunk-based development][trunk-based development: a comprehensive guide] and other branching strategies all work.<br/>
  Consider the [different pros and cons of each][git branching strategies vs. trunk-based development].
- Refactoring _can_ be an option.<br/>
  Just **don't** use it mindlessly.
- _DevOps_, _GitOps_ and other similar terms are sets of practices, suggestions, or approaches.<br/>
  They are **not** roles or job titles.<br/>
  They are **not** to be taken literally.<br/>
  They **need** to be adapted to the workplace, not the other way around.
- Be aware of [corporate bullshit][from inboxing to thought showers: how business bullshit took over].
- [Amazon's leadership principles] are double-edge swords.<br/>
  Only Amazon was able to apply them as they are defined, and they still create a lot of discontent.

## CI/CD specific

- Keep _integration_, _delivery_ and _deployment_ separated.<br/>
  They are different concepts, and as such should require different tasks.<br/>
  This also allows for checkpoints, and to fail fast with less to no unwanted consequence.

### Pipelining

- Differentiate what the concept of pipelines really is from the idea of pipelines in approaches like DevOps.<br/>
  Pipelines are sequences of actions. Pipelines in DevOps and alike end up being magic tools to take actions away from people.
- Keep in mind [the automation paradox].<br/>
  Pipelines tend to easily become complex systems just like Rube Goldberg machines.
- Keep tasks as simple, consistent and reproducible as possible.<br/>
  Avoid like the plague to put programs or scripts in pipelines: they should be _glue_, not replace applications.
- All tasks should be able to execute from one's own local machine.<br/>
  This allows to fail fast and avoid wasting time waiting for pipelines to run in a blackbox somewhere.
- DevOps pipelines are meant to be used as **last mile** steps for specific goals.<br/>
  There **cannot** be a single pipeline for everything, the same way as the _one-size-fits-all_ concept never really works.

## Product engineering

Consider what follows for infrastructure and platform engineering as well.

- Focus on creating things users will want to use.<br/>
  Tools should solve issues and alleviate pain points, not create additional walls.
- Focus on small audiences first. Avoid trying appealing lots of users from the beginning.<br/>
  If you do not have a user base, the product has no reason to exist but your will to create it.
- Consider and fix users' pain points **before** adding new features.<br/>
  If users are not happy with your tool, they'll try moving away from it.
