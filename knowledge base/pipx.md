# Pipx

Tool to help install and run end-user applications written in Python.

It acts as a package manager using [`pip`][pip] behind the scenes, but is focused on installing and managing Python packages that can be run from the command line directly as applications.

The `install` command automatically creates a Python virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's associated applications (entry points) to a location in PATH. For this reason, `pipx` never needs to run as `root`.<br/>
For example, `pipx install 'pycowsay'` makes the `pycowsay` command available globally, but sandboxes the package in its own virtual environment.
