# Gatus

Health dashboard.

It allows to monitor services using HTTP, ICMP, TCP, and DNS queries.<br/>
One can evaluate the result of said queries by using a list of conditions on values (like status code, response time, certificate expiration, body and many others).

Each health check can be paired with alerting via Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Twilio and many more.
