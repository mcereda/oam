## TL;DR

```sh
# Manjaro.
sudo pamac install 'sane-airscan' 'skanlite'
```

## Procedure

Install:

- the `sane-airscan` package, if the scanner is known to work in driverless mode;
- the `sane` package to use old driver-based scanning.

If the scanner is using a USB connection, make sure to also install the `ipp-usb` package and start/enable the `ipp-usb`
service to allow using IPP protocol over USB connection.

Many modern scanners will immediately work over the network as long as you have `sane-airscan` installed.

SANE has lots of front ends, a non-exhaustive list of which can be found on the [sane project website][sane frontends]:

- [Simple Scan]: a simplified GUI intended to be easier to use and better integrated into the GNOME desktop than `XSane`
  is;
- [Skanlite]: a simple image scanning application; it does nothing more than scan and save images, and is based on the
  KSane backend;
- XSane: a full-featured GTK-based frontend; looks a bit old but provides extended functionalities.

Some OCR software are able to scan images using SANE, like gImageReader, [gscan2pdf], Linux-Intelligent-Ocr-Solution, [OCRFeeder] and [Paperwork].
