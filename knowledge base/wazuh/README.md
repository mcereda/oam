## Components

| Component | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Indexer   | Central  | Full-text search and analytics engine.<br/>Indexes and stores alerts generated by the server.                                                          |
| Server    | Central  | Analyzes data received from the agents.<br/>Can set up in a cluster.<br/>Manages the agents.                                                           |
| Dashboard | Central  | Web UI for data visualization and analysis.<br/>Used to configure and monitor Wazuh.                                                                   |
| Agent     | Endpoint | Installed on monitored endpoints (i.e.: laptops, servers, cloud instances, virtual machines).<br/>Used for threat prevention, detection, and response. |

Wazuh can also monitor agent-less devices (e.g: firewalls, switches, routers) via Syslog, SSH or APIs.

### Indexer

Stores data as JSON documents.

_Indexes_ are collections of documents related to each other.<br/>
The stored documents are distributed across multiple different _shards_.<br/>
Shards are distributed on multiple nodes for redundancy.

Different indices store different event types.

| Index              | Content                                      | Notes                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wazuh-alerts`     | Alerts generated by the server               | Created each time an event trips a rule with a high enough priority.                                                      |
| `wazuh‑archives`   | Events received by the server                | Created whether or not events trip a rule.                                                                                |
| `wazuh‑monitoring` | Data related to the agent's status over time | Used by the web interface to show when individual agents are or have been _active_, _disconnected_, or _never connected_. |
| `wazuh‑statistics` | Data related to the server's performance     | Used by the web interface to show performance statistics.                                                                 |

One can interact with the indexer cluster using its REST API.
