## Lifecycle configuration

When you have multiple rules in an S3 Lifecycle configuration, an object can become eligible for multiple S3 Lifecycle actions. In such cases, Amazon S3 follows these general rules:

1. Permanent deletion takes precedence over transition.
1. Transition takes precedence over creation of delete markers.
1. When an object is eligible for both a S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Standard-IA (or S3 One Zone-IA) transition, Amazon S3 chooses the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval transition.

Propagation delay: When you add an S3 Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, there is usually some lag before a new or updated Lifecycle configuration is fully propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems. Expect a delay of a few minutes before the configuration fully takes effect. This delay can also occur when you delete an S3 Lifecycle configuration.

Objects can only go down the tiers, not up. Many other constraints apply, like no transition done for objects <128KiB.<br/>
