## TL;DR

Imagine a radar.

Divide the radar in multiple concentric _rings_.<br/>
The rings should represent the confidence of technologies adoption, something like follows (inner to outer):

- Adopt: technologies that one should seriously consider using.
- Trial: technologies that one could consider ready for use, but not with the level of confidence granted to those in
  the Adopt ring.
- Assess: technologies to look at closely, but not necessarily in Trial yet; to consider trying should one think they
  would be a particularly good fit.
- Hold: unknown technologies; proceed with caution.

Divide the radar in _quadrants_.<br/>
Quadrants should represent groups of technologies (e.g.: tools, platforms, languages…).

Each technology insight is represented by a _blip_.<br/>
Blips can (and in time, should) move between rings as one's recommendation changes.
