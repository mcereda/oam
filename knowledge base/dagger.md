# Dagger

Open-source runtime for composable workflows.<br/>
Intended for systems with many moving parts and strong needs for repeatability, modularity, observability and
cross-platform support, which makes it good for AI agents and CI/CD workflows.

Tries to replace software projects' artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.<br/>
Helps to create consistent and reliable local development and testing environments that can do whatever one's CI can.
