# Hadolint's official docker image is based on 'scratch', and takes only one input file at a time.
# I have no clue how to fix that at the time of writing so let's just use the local command.


bootstrap:
  commands:
    hadolint:
      run: brew install 'hadolint'

lint:
  commands:
    docker: &hadolint
      glob: "*[Dd]ockerfile*"
      run: hadolint {all_files}


pre-commit:
  commands:
    lint-docker:
      <<: *hadolint
      run: hadolint {staged_files}
